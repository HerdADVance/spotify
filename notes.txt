Based on the search results provided, here are the steps to deploy a Django app from your local machine to a hosting service like Namecheap's shared hosting:
Set up Python and Django on the Hosting Server
Log in to your Namecheap cPanel and go to "Setup Python App"
Create a new Python application, selecting the latest Python version
Specify the application root folder (e.g. "my_django_app") and your domain
Set the startup file to "passenger_wsgi.py" and entry point to "application"
3
Configure Django for Production
Update your local Django settings.py file:
Set DEBUG = False
Add your domain to ALLOWED_HOSTS
Configure database settings (e.g. MySQL if using Namecheap's databases)
Run python manage.py collectstatic to collect static files
Upload Django Project Files
Connect to your hosting via FTP or SSH File Manager
Upload/transfer your entire Django project folder to the application root folder you specified earlier
3

Create and Configure WSGI File
In the application root folder, create a passenger_wsgi.py file
Import your Django app's application object:
python
from my_django_app.wsgi import application

This allows the web server to serve your Django app
3
Set up Database
Create a new MySQL database from cPanel if needed
Update database settings in settings.py with credentials
Run Django Migrations
Connect to your hosting server via SSH
Navigate to your project folder
Activate the Python virtual environment if used
Run python manage.py migrate to apply database migrations
Start/Restart Web Server
Your Django app should now be accessible via the domain you specified
The key steps are setting up Python/Django on the shared hosting, configuring Django for production, uploading your project files, creating the WSGI entry point, setting up the database, running migrations, and then starting the web server to serve your app.
